- Object Oriented (no inheritance, just composition);
- The low-level background C++ functions are compiled;
- High-level uses Just-in-Time Compilation;
- Close to C++ performance;
- Easy to read threads syntax that resemble go routines;
- Mark-sweep garbage collector with a go-like memory pool;
- Ease of extending it with C++ functions.

**Make**

- Requires a Linux distro;

- clang version 19;
  
```bash
wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
chmod +x llvm.sh
sudo ./llvm.sh 19 all

sudo apt-get install llvm clang zlib1g-dev libzstd-dev libeigen3-dev libopencv-dev
```
- Add commands `nsk` to `PATH`:

```bash
./alias.sh
```

- Make:

```bash
make -j8
```

This adds nsk to bin/nsk
